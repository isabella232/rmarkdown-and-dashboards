## and do it all

### with R Markdown

Your data tells a ~~joke~~ story. Tell it with `R` Markdown. Turn your analyses into **high quality** documents, reports, presentations and dashboards -- and don't forget to drink some H~2~0 while you do that.[^1]

R Markdown documents are fully reproducible. Use a productive [notebook interface](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html)[^2] to weave together narrative text and code to produce *elegantly formatted* output. Use multiple languages including 

- R
- Python

and

- SQL

Do you need still need convincing to use R Markdown? See what a friend once said:

> I used to use Sweave, and get terrible headaches. Now I use R Markdown, 
> and life is much more pleasant.
