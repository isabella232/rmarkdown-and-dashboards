mtcars$cyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

### Frame 1: This is a *very* short story, told in only 3 frames. We begin by comparing engine displacement versus horsepower.


```{r plot1}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp, hp, color = cyl)) + geom_point()
```

***

This is the commentary that goes with our first plot. It is graphing engine displacement versus horsepower, which typically correlate positively.

### Frame 2: This frame compares horsepower against fuel mileage.  {data-commentary-width=400}

```{r plot2}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, hp, color = cyl)) + geom_point()
```

***

This is the commentary about plot 2, which shows that horsepower and fuel mileage are inversely correlated.

### Frame 3: A cat photo {data-commentary-width=400}

![*Waffles in a box*](images/cat_photo.png)

***

Why analyze cars when you can admire a cat in a box?
